/*
Given a list of data, implement the following 3 methods using LINQ in a class that allows for managing employees:

AverageAgeForEachCompany: calculates the average age of employees for each unique company and
returns the results as a Dictionary<string, int> sorted by key, where Key[string] is the unique company name,
and Value[int] is the average age of employees in this company. The average age is rounded to the nearest whole number.

CountOfEmployeesForEachCompany: calculates the count of employees for each unique company and
returns the results as a Dictionary<string, int> sorted by key, where Key[string] is the unique company name,
and Value[int] is the count of employees in this company.

OldestAgeForEachCompany: finds the oldest aged employee for each unique company and returns the
results as a Dictionary<string, Employee> sorted by key, where Key[string] is the unique company name,
and Value[Employee] is the oldest employee in this company.

Here is the description of the Employee class:

FirstName [string] - the first name of the employee.
LastName[string] - the last name of the employee.
Company [string] - the company of the employee.
Age [int] - the age of the employee.
Your implementation of the class will be tested by a stubbed code on several input files.
The input file contains parameters for the function calls (i.e., the employee data).
The functions will be called with those parameters, and the result of their executions will be printed to the standard output by the stubbed code.

Input Format For Custom Testing:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of employees on which operations have to be performed.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < n) contains space-separated strings,
such that the first of them is the first name of the employee, the second is the last name of the employee,
the third is the company of the employee, and the fourth is the age of the employee, respectively.
